# 🎮 Kaboom.js Portfolio Website

Welcome to my interactive portfolio — built entirely using **Kaboom.js**, a 2D game programming library for JavaScript! Instead of a traditional portfolio, I decided to turn things up a notch and build a playable experience that shows off my personality, creativity, and web dev skills.

This is a fun side project I really enjoyed making — it’s playful, unique, and reflects how much I love combining creativity with code.

---

## 🌟 Features

- Built using [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/) for a fun 2D game experience
- Interactive sections representing my portfolio (About, Projects, Contact, etc.)
- Tiled map integration (`map.json`) for level layout
- Collision handling and interactive objects
- Clean structure with modules and async logic

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Kaboom.js** – 2D game engine
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Game logic
- **Tiled** – Map design (`map.json`)
- **Vite** – Fast build tool
- **HTML/CSS** – Wrapper and styling

## 🤔 Why I Made This

As someone who enjoys both web development and game design, I wanted my portfolio to reflect that creativity. Using Kaboom.js, it allowed me to break away from standard templates and create something **fun**, **interactive**, and **personal**.
